## Wen-Da Jin (金闻达)

I’m currently a second-year master student in the College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, but actually supervised by Dr. [Jun Xu](https://csjunxu.github.io/) of Nankai University. Before that, I received my bachelor degree at Anhui University. My research focuses on computer vision, especially salient object detection.
